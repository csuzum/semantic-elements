    <h1>Semantic Elements Summarized</h1>
    <aside><h2>What is Divitis?</h2>
      <p>Divitis is a common problem with web designers. It is the process of using too many nested/unnecessary <b>divs</b> to mark up a page.</p></aside>
      <p>Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both browsers and developers. The elements <mark><b>div</b></mark> and <mark><b>span</b></mark> are essentially generic in content, lack a clear definition and we have better alternatives now. For example, instead of <b>div</b> with <b>IDs</b> and <b>classes</b>, HTML5 uses elements such as <b>section</b>, <b>aside</b>, <b>table</b>, <b>form</b>, and <b>article</b> that make the intent of the components more apparent. These more clearly defined semantic tags make the content more accessible, increase searchability, better understood by non-native English speakers, and help other programmers understand the structure. HTML is about organization of the content. Elements previously used to describe styling have been depreciated from use in HTML. Instead, styling and presentational elements such as <b>center</b>, <b>font</b>, <b>small</b>, <b>footer</b>, and <b>img</b> should be handled in CSS.</p>
